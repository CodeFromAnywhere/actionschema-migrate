This CLI performs a migration on remote ActionSchema microservices and creates an SDK and Typescript Types in your codebase afterwards.

Usage:

1. Setup your `actionschema.json`

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://migrate.actionschema.com/migration-context.schema.json"
  //autocomplete from here
}
```

2. Run `bunx actionschema-migrate` and follow further instructions.
